# Date Deck 💕

[My Notes](notes.md)

Date Deck will be an application for couples looking to streamline their date nights. Users will be able to add a date idea as a card to their deck, and when the night comes, they can look through their ideas or randomly draw a card. Additionally, users will be able to post their dates to their friends and get ideas by scrolling through their friends' posts.

> [!NOTE]
> This is a template for your startup application. You must modify this `README.md` file for each phase of your development. You only need to fill in the section for each deliverable when that deliverable is submitted in Canvas. Without completing the section for a deliverable, the TA will not know what to look for when grading your submission. Feel free to add additional information to each deliverable description, but make sure you at least have the list of rubric items and a description of what you did for each item.

For this deliverable I did the following. I checked the box `[x]` and added a description for things I completed.

- [x] Proper use of Markdown
- [x] A concise and compelling elevator pitch
- [x] Description of key features
- [x] Description of how you will use each technology

### Elevator pitch

If you're a romantic like me, I'm sure you've found yourself constantly mentioning things you want to do with your significant other. But after only a couple of weeks of dating, you've already forgotten half the things you wanted to do and aren’t sure what to pick for your next date activity. May I present to you, DateDeck: an app that will ensure that your date ideas are never lost in the wind. DateDeck will keep track of any date idea you have and organize it into a deck, which you can look through and pull randomly out of when the date night arrives.

### Design

After creating an account, the user will open the application to the hompage consisting of the main feature, adding a date card to your deck. There will be two other pages the user can navigate to at the bottom of the screen. The first is to see their deck and have the option to randomly draw a card from it. The second is the social feed from other users’ dates.

### Key features

- Add a date idea
- Ask for a random idea with optional specifications from your deck, or a general deck
- View your deck of date ideas
- Post about your date to your frineds
- View your frineds posts about their dates

### Technologies

I am going to use the required technologies in the following ways.

- **HTML** - Authentication - allow users to log in to their account.
           - Redering - to render the user's date cards and other users' posts. 
- **CSS** - To make the application cute and appealing to couples.
- **React** - To build all dynamic UI, such as their decks or posting options.
- **Service** - To enable an AI date idea generator. The app will make a call to the AI agent.
- **DB/Login** - To save the user's profile, posts, dates, and so on.
- **WebSocket** - To see other users' posts and to send posts to the page.
